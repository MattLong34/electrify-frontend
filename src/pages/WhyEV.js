			<h3>Why Electric Vehicles?</h3>
			<p>
				Even though electric cars are receiving more positive attention and
				becoming more common, adoption is slow. This is typical of any new
				technology. It’s due in part to the fact that people don’t trust
				electric vehicle (EV) technology and have many doubts. In fact, there
				are still many people who simply don’t think EVs can ever replace gas
				cars. While many automakers are making strides in electrification, it
				seems most aren’t ready to transition just yet.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are some obvious reasons the public isn’t buying into EVs, such as
				upfront costs, lack of availability, and range anxiety. However, many
				myths have clouded the segment for some time now. Some of these myths
				may be somewhat valid in certain circumstances or may have been true in
				the past, but times are changing and technology has improved drastically
				since EVs first entered the market.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, EVs comprise less than 2% of the automotive market in the
				U.S. This means it will be many years before adoption is widespread.
				However, with a multitude of automakers bringing electrified vehicles to
				market in the near future, growth is accelerating more rapidly. Over
				time, with more electric vehicles available, increased charging
				infrastructure deployment, and reduced production and battery costs, the
				EV segment should begin to prosper.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep reading to learn why many of the arguments against EVs aren’t
				necessarily valid, and to see whether an electric car would be a good
				choice for you – either now, or in the future.
